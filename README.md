## Project Title
Optimization of Arch Support Insoles through Genetic Algorithm

## Project Description
This project enhances the functionality and comfort of insoles by optimizing their design parameters using a genetic algorithm. Implemented in Python, the project aims to optimize key parameters such as arch length, width, and height through a parametric design process, addressing the specific needs of students in costume performance disciplines.

## Installation Guide
### Environment Requirements
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Matplotlib

### Installation Steps
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Data Preparation
Ensure your data is formatted according to the project requirements, which should include parameters such as arch length, width, and height.

### Running the Algorithm
Run the main program:
```bash
python main.py
```
You can adjust the settings of the genetic algorithm, such as population size and number of iterations, by modifying the `config.json` file.
